## About
I decided to use [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) to visualize percentage of
seats held by women in National Parliaments. Detailed information about the
dataset can be found [here](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w9).

After looking at the dataset, I decided to focus on only certain countries as it
is quite challenging to visualize all of the provided 32 countries. I selected
the countries according to their region within Europe. More specifically,
I decided to look closely on western, eastern and nordic countries. From each of
these regions, I selected three countries. The selection was based on my
personal preference rather than a random process.

Finally, since the timespan of data was quite large, i.e. going from 2003 to
2019, I felt like this is very hard to comprehend by human vision all at once.
Fortunately, Flourish allowed me to set the focus on a certain time window as
part of the animation. In terms of colors, I decided to color countries by their
regions which allowed me to highlight the trend showing that nordic countries
have more women in parliament than west and east. Similar parallel than holds
for west and east. In addition, the reader can select to look at only a certain
  region which I believe helps the reader to examine micro trends in the data.
